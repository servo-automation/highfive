## About this submodule

This repository contains only the handlers corresponding to an [`issues`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#issuesevent) event. It's a submodule of the [main repo](https://github.com/servo-highfive/highfive).

Some of the handlers are a rework of the handlers in servo's [highfive](https://github.com/servo/highfive/tree/master/handlers). For any changes (or feature requests) related to this module, please open a PR :)
